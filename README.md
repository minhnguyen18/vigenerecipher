## Vignere Cipher 
This is one of my first projects to implement the Vignere Cipher method after taking Intro to Cryptography class! 
<p>Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution which is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.
